# MCP3208 Mbed OS example

The example project is part of the [Arm Mbed OS Official Examples](https://os.mbed.com/code/) and is the [getting started example for Mbed OS](https://os.mbed.com/docs/mbed-os/latest/quick-start/index.html). It contains an application that repeatedly blinks an LED on supported [Mbed boards](https://os.mbed.com/platforms/).

You can build the project with all supported [Mbed OS build tools](https://os.mbed.com/docs/mbed-os/latest/tools/index.html). However, this example project specifically refers to the command-line interface tool [Arm Mbed CLI](https://github.com/ARMmbed/mbed-cli#installing-mbed-cli).
(Note: To see a rendered example you can import into the Arm Online Compiler, please see our [import quick start](https://os.mbed.com/docs/mbed-os/latest/quick-start/online-with-the-online-compiler.html#importing-the-code).)
